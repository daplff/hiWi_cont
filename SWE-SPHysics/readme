1. File Structure
The SWE-SPHYSICS code has the following structure:

directories:
  execs		: executable files
  execs.bak	: backup executable files
  Post-Processing: plotting routines are located here under matlabRoutines
  run_directory	: each demonstration case is under a separate subdirectory, e.g. CaseN
  source	: the fortran source codes are contained under two subdirectories SPHYSICS_SWE_2D and SPHYSICS_SWE_gen2D



2. Running SWE-SPHYSICS

Which Compilers?
- Under windows the code has been run using the Intel ifort compiler and the Silverfrost/Salford FTN95, as well as the GCC gfortran compiler on cygwin (linux emulator).
- Under linux the code has been run using the GCC gfortran compiler and the non-commerical version of the Intel ifort compiler. These compilers along with the GNU Make utility should be available on the machine's default PATH.

NOTE: The choice of compiler is controlled by one of the last options in the input file for each demonstration case located under: run_directory/CaseN/CaseN.txt.
1 - gfortran
2 - ifort (linux/unix)
3 - Intel ifort for Windows
4 - Silverfrost/Salford ftn95 (Windows)

(i)    COMPILE & RUN SWE-SPHYSICS EXECUTABLE IN ONE STEP

After compiling SPHYSICS_SWE_gen, change to directory: run_directory/CaseN/ where N is the number of the case to run.

LINUX/UNIX:   Open the file CaseN.txt in a text editor and change the number on the penultimate line to 1 (for gfortran) or 2(for ifort). Then type the following at the command prompt.

    ./CaseN_unix_gfortran.bat   OR   ./CaseN_unix_ifort.bat

ifort on WINDOWS:  Open the file CaseN.txt in a text editor and change the number on the penultimate line to 3 for the CVF compiler on windows. Then type the following at the command prompt

   .\CaseN_windows_ifort.bat

FTN95 on WINDOWS: Open the file CaseN.txt in a text editor and change the number on the penultimate line to 4 for the Silverfrost FTN95 compiler on windows. Then type the following at the command prompt

   .\CaseN_windows_ftn95.bat

NOTES:	(i)  for FTN95 you must have the file default.mk in the source directories.
	(ii) in the CaseN.txt file, there must be a space character " " (not a TAB) after each numerical entry

gfortran on cygwin WINDOWS: Open the file CaseN.txt in a text editor and change the number on the last line to 1 (for gfortran). Then type the following at the command prompt.

    ./CaseN_windows_cygwin_gfortran.bat

This compiles and runs the SWE-SPHYSICS code. For further details on running the test cases please refer to the SWE-SPHYSICS User's Manual.


(ii)   COMPILE SPHYSICS_SWE_gen EXECUTABLE ONLY

Once the code is downladed, the pre-processing program SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_2D should be compiled. To do this,

Change to directory: source/SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_2D/
gfortran on linux:     make -f SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_gfortran.mak
ifort on linux: make -f SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_ifort.mak
ifort on windows:  NMAKE/f"SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_win_ifort.mak"
Silverfrost FTN95 on windows: mk32 -f SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_ftn95.mak
gfortran on cygwin: make -f SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_gfortran.mak


(iii)  COMPILE SPHYSICS_SWE EXECUTABLE ONLY

To compile the SPHYSICS_SWE_2D executable only, a Makefile (say SPHYSICS_SWE.mak), needs to be generated by running SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_2D. Then this Makefile has to be copied to the directory /source/SPHYSICS_SWE_2D. Then

Change to directory: source/SPHYSICS_SWE_2D/
linux/cygwin:     make -f SPHYSICS_SWE.mak
ifort on Windows:   NMAKE/f"SPHYSICS_SWE.mak"
FTN95 on Windows: mk32 -f SPHYSICS_SWE.mak

(iv)   GENERATE GEOMETRY & INPUT FILES

Change to directory: run_directory/CaseN where N is the number of the case to run.

LINUX/UNIX:     Open the file CaseN.txt in a text editor and change the number on the last line to 1 (for gfortran) or 2(for ifort). Then type the following at the command prompt.

../../execs/SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_2D < CaseN.txt


Intel IFORT, FTN95 or gfortran on WINDOWS:  Open the file CaseN.txt in a text editor and change the number on the last line to 3 (for the CVF compiler), 4 (for FTN95) or 1 (for gfortran on windows). Then type the following at the command prompt

 ..\..\execs\SPHYSICS_SWE_gen_2D.exe < CaseN.txt

NOTES:	(i)  for FTN95 you must have the file default.mk in the source directories.
	(ii) in the CaseN.txt file, there must be a space character " " (not a TAB) after each numerical entry


3. Plotting SWE-SPHYSICS output
SWE-SPHYSICS comes with routines to plot the results in both Matlab and ParaView 3.0+.  The SWE-SPHYSICS code generates the following output files:
PART_ijkl	: Particle Field snap shot, x y z u v w ....
DT		: Output timesteps of PART_ijkl files

These files are generated in the current working directory for each case, i.e. run_directory/CaseN/
To plot the results, more information can be found under each directory: 
Post-Processing/fortranRoutines/README and 
Post-Processing/matlabRoutines/README.
