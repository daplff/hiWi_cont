1. Files
This directory contains the source code for converting the SPHYSICS ascii output files (PART_ijkl) to VTU format for use in ParaView
source code:	PART2VTU_SWE_2D.f
make files:	PART2VTU_SWE_gfortran.mak
		PART2VTU_SWE_ifort.mak
		PART2VTU_SWE_ftn95.mak
batch files:	PART2VTU_SWE_windows_ftn95.bat
		PART2VTU_SWE_unix_gfortran.bat
		PART2VTU_SWE_unix_ifort.bat
		PART2VTU_SWE_windows_cygwin_gfortran.bat

2. Running PART2VTU_SWE_2D
Which Compilers?
- Under windows the code has been run using the Silverfrost FTN95 fortran compiler.
- Under linux the code has been run using the GCC gfortran compiler and the Intel ifort compiler. These compilers along with the GNU Make utility should be available on the machine's default PATH.


(i) COPY PART2VTU_SWE batch file
Copy the relevant batch file from this directory to the directory run_directory/CaseN/

Change to directory: run_directory/CaseN/

(ii) COMPILE & RUN PART2VTU_SWE EXECUTABLE IN ONE STEP

In directory: run_directory/CaseN/ where N is the number of the case to run.

LINUX/UNIX:
      ./PART2VTU_SWE_unix_ifort.bat   OR ./PART2VTU_SWE_unix_gfortran.bat

FTN95 on WINDOWS:
      .\PART2VTU_SWE_windows_ftn95.bat

gfortran on Cygwin (WINDOWS):
      ./PART2VTU_SWE_windows_cygwin_gfortran.bat

This compiles and runs the PART2VTU_SWE code creating an executable in directory execs/.  
Answer Input Questions


3. Plotting PART2VTU_SWE output
SPHYSICS comes with routines to plot the results in both Matlab and ParaView 3.  The SPHYSICS code generates the following output files:
PART_ijkl	: Particle Field snap shot, x y z u v w ....
DT		: Output timesteps of PART_ijkl files

Under the following directory run_directory/CaseN/ParaviewFiles/VTU/, PART2VTU_SWE generates the following files:
PARTijkl.vtu
VTUinp.pvd

If the directories ParaviewFiles/VTU/ do not exist, they are created in the current working directory for each case, i.e. run_directory/CaseN/

Plotting in ParaView 3:
(i)    In ParaView, use the Pipeline browser to load in the .vtu files.
(ii)   For animations, load only the pvd file in first, click Apply.
(iii)  Use Filters and Threshold, etc., on scalar values, etc., to create desired image.
