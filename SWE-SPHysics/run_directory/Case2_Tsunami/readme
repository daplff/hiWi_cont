--- QUICKSTART GUIDE TO PLOTTING SPHYSICS RESULTS ---

This directory contains the Matlab routines for visualizing SWE-SPHYSICS results using Matlab.

Given below is a brief description of the files:

1) SPHYSICS_SWE_2D_Plot.m:
   This is the main program that needs to be executed to visualize the results in Matlab. This loads the input files DT, sets the figure properties. 

2) grd_read_v2.m (called by SPHYSICS_SWE_2D_Plot.m) load the .GRD files created by the SPHYSICS_SWE_2D code.

PROGRAM LOCATION:

These programs search for the input files DT, the PART_ijkl, the GRD_dijkl the GRD_uijkl and the the GRD_vijkl files in the current matlab working directory. Hence, these *.m files should either:

1) be copied to the run_directory/CaseN directory where the input files DT, maltabin and the PART_ijkl files are located, or

2) be left under Post-Processing/matlabRoutines/ and have their location added to Matlab's default search path (search www.mathworks.com for more info).


PROGRAM EXECUTION:

To run these plotting routines, first change directory to run_directory/CaseN.

1) Plotting in Matlab
At the command prompt in matlab, enter:
SPHYSICS_SWE_2D_Plot
